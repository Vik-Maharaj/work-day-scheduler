# Vik's Work Day Scheduler

## Description

During any given work day, there is a lot to do! Sometimes it feels like there are never enough hours during the day to get anything done. Given how hectic a day can seem, and how difficult it can be to manage tasks, assignments, and other work-day responsibilities, the best way to prevent that feeling is to schedule out any given work day. A good schedule can help keep items manageable, and allow certain activities to be completed at the right times, freeing up mental bandwidth and limiting stress and anxiety so that a person can focus on the task of the moment.

With that in mind, the purpose of this project is to create a daily planner that allows a user to schedule their activities during the day, separating them into blocks of time. The segmented scheduler can be utilized by anyone, resides entirely online, and includes the following features:

- The scheduler is web-based and can be used by anyone with an internet connection
- The app displays the current date and time at the top of the page
- The user is presented with blocks of time for standard business hours (9am to 5pm)
- The blocks of time are color coded to indicate which hours are in the past, which is the current hour, and which hours are in the future
- The user can click into the time block and can schedule an event
- Once the event is entered, the user can save the event and the item is stored in local storage and persists even if the page is refreshed

By using this app, anyone can simply and effectively manage their time better.
